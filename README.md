# Project Tipig
In Hiligaynon, *tipig* means: 

> preserving, keeping (in a safe state); to guard well, reserve, preserve, keep, and save.

## Background
I have aphantasia (I can only see black when I close my eyes) and a hard time remembering things, so preserving my memories is super important to me. Capturing those imperfect, emotional moments helps me relive them later, no matter how happy or messy they are. [link this to the web app]

## Goal

To preserve these imperfect memories through a camera lens, capturing the feelings and emotions of those precious moments. These photos serve as reminders and help me feel something meaningful. [insert web app link] At the same time, this project allows me to explore and learn new front-end technologies. It is my way of keeping, preserving, and *tipig*an my memories while expanding my technical knowledge.

When accessing this web app, I want to evoke the same feelings you get when walking through a museum or gallery, marveling at beautiful works of art — whether paintings, sculptures, or other creations. In this case, the works are my photos — my memories.

## Design/Implementation

Keep it as simple as possible.
